                        car in real time. The application is available as a Docker image on the GitHub Container
                        Registry, and the project includes batch and bash scripts to simplify the process of pulling and
                        running the image. The dashboard can display up to ten minutes of data. Additionally, it is able
                        to record testing data and convert it into Excel CSV files. In order to enable multiple

                        establishing a cellular connection on each host device, the dashboard interfaces with a separate

                        to the engineering dashboard directly over a radio connection, if available. In addition, the
                        driver dashboard automatically switches between communication methods depending on their
                        connection status and priority. If neither is available, it queues datasets and resends them
